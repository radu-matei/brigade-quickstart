# Getting started with Brigade

Following the [quickstart][quickstart], we deploy Brigade on our cluster using Helm 3:

```
$ helm version
version.BuildInfo{Version:"v3.0.0-beta.4"}

$ helm repo add brigade https://brigadecore.github.io/charts
$ kubectl create ns brigade
$ kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=brigade
$ helm install brigade --namespace brigade brigade/brigade

$ kubectl get all

We can see that by default, Brigade is really lightweight:

- a Kubernetes controller, which looks for Brigade events
- an API which we use to interact with Brigade
- an optional web dashboard

Additionally, we can configure components called gateways, which are used to map outside events into Brigade. Brigade comes with a few pre-configured gateways:

- a generic web gateway for webhooks, which can be used with CloudEvents or any other valid JSON
- GitHub integration, with support for the new Checks API
- support for container registries, other git platforms (GitLab, BitBucket, Azure DevOps), cron jobs, Azure EventGrid, Trello, Kubernetes events, Kafka, and others

- using the Brigade API, it is easy to build custom gateways to connect to internal / external systems
